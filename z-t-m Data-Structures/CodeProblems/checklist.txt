Good code checklist:

[✅]It works
[✅]Good use of data structures
[✅]Code Re-use/ Do Not Repeat Yourself
[✅]Modular - makes code more readable, maintainable and testable
[✅]Less than O(N^2). We want to avoid nested loops if we can since they are expensive. Two separate loops are better than 2 nested loops
[✅]Low Space Complexity --> Recursion can cause stack overflow, copying of large arrays may exceed memory of machine

Heurestics to ace the question:

[✅]Hash Maps are usually the answer to improve Time Complexity
[✅]If it's a sorted array, use Binary tree to achieve O(log N). 
Divide and Conquer - Divide a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. 
Binary search is a great example of this
[✅]Try Sorting your input
[✅]Hash tables and precomputed information (i.e. sorted) are some of the best ways to optimize your code
[✅]Look at the Time vs Space tradeoff. Sometimes storing extra state in memory can help the time. (Runtime)
[✅]If the interviewer is giving you advice/tips/hints. Follow them
[✅]Space time tradeoffs: Hastables usually solve this a lot of the times. You use more space, but you can get a time optimization to the process. 
In programming, you often times can use up a little bit more space to get faster time
